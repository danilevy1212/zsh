* ZSH Config

** INSTALLATION

This configuration requires to change the value of the ~ZDOTDIR~, which in most linux distros is first defined in ~/etc/zsh/zshenv~,
to a directory of your choosing. The .zshrc that resides in said directory will be read each time a new zsh session is started.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

  # /etc/zsh/zshenv
  export ZDOTDIR="$HOME/.config/zsh"

#+END_SRC

After changing ~ZDOTDIR~, just download the repo:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

  git clone https://github.com/danilevy1212/zsh.git $ZDOTDIR

#+END_SRC
