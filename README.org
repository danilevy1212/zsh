* ZSH Config

** INSTALLATION

   This configuration requires to change the value of the ~ZDOTDIR~, which in most linux distros is first defined in ~/etc/zsh/zshenv~,
   to a directory of your choosing. The .zshrc that resides in said directory will be read each time a new zsh session is started.

   After changing ~ZDOTDIR~, just run this command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

git clone git@github.com:danilevy1212/zsh.git $ZDOTDIR

   #+END_SRC
